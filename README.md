# about HH Systems
The Purpose of HH Systems is to design opensource at home Manufactuing solutions. 3D printing, plasme cutting, milling, bascicaly any machiner or process that can be used for at home manufacturing. we want to make it, open source it, and build an ecosystem around it. We have seen 3d printing absolutly explode in the past decade and becasue of the massive interest in it, 3d printing has become accessable for just about everyone. At HH Systems we want to see the same thing happen with machining and other forms of manufacturing. How will we make money if its open source? our plan is to keep all hardware and software open source. But we will sell instructions and machine kits. People are welcome to take our materials and hardware lists, as well as our software and build our machines to thier hearts delight. We have already released a frame kit which was initialy built years ago for the Anet A8. But our first 2 projects we will be focusing on are a [3d printer](https://github.com/hh-systems/Ahmi-3D) and [CNC Plasma Cutting Table](https://github.com/hh-systems/iocut). The reasoning for these two machines specificaly is they both serve as a basis for anyone to get started. A 3d printer can make a whole lotta parts you need for other machines. And a plasma cutter opens up another realm for making things. Both of those motion systems can be used for multiple use cases. router tables, laster cutter tables, waterjet tables, just to name a couple thoughts on the subject.
